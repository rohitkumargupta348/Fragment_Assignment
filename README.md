# Fragment_Assignment

# Task-Fragmentation

AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragment the UI into selective components to make it more readable

# My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that

i.Dividing the code into components makes it readable and clean.
ii.Debugging becomes much more easier as we can easily predict where our code went wrong
iii.Easy, understandable and prettier code
iv.More re-use of components already defined.
