# Fragment_Assignment

# Task-Fragmentation

AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragment the UI into selective components to make it more readable

# My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that

<p> i.Dividing the code into components makes it readable and clean.</p>

<p> ii.Debugging becomes much more easier as we can easily predict where our code went wrong</p>

<p> iii.Easy, understandable and prettier code</p>

<p> iv.More re-use of components already defined.</p>
